# Smart_Passcode

Smart Passcode is a real-time hand gesture recognition safe box integrated with external hardware control using TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and Arduino.

## Overview
Smart Passcode was developed as part of MakeUofT, Canada's largest Make-a-thon, where our team aimed to create a secure and intuitive authentication system. By leveraging machine learning and computer vision techniques, we enabled users to interact with the system through intuitive numerical hand gestures, opening up possibilities for applications in robotics, home automation, and beyond.

## Features
- Real-time hand gesture recognition using TensorFlow and Keras
- Integration with OpenCV for precise hand tracking and gesture classification
- Bidirectional communication with an Arduino Uno for controlling external hardware components
- Intuitive numerical hand gestures for password input
- Custom-built machine learning model trained on a dataset of hand gesture images
